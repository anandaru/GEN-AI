It builds upon the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture with several key improvements aimed at enhancing performance and robustness. Here are the main features and enhancements of RoBERTa:\n","\n","Key Features of RoBERTa:\n","Training Data: RoBERTa uses a much larger dataset for pre-training compared to BERT. It is trained on a combination of datasets, including the BookCorpus, English Wikipedia, Common Crawl News, OpenWebText, and Stories from Common Crawl.\n","\n","Training Time and Batch Size: RoBERTa increases the amount of training time and the batch size. This allows the model to learn more effectively from the data.\n","\n","Dynamic Masking: Unlike BERT, which uses a static masking pattern for its masked language modeling task, RoBERTa applies dynamic masking, meaning the masking pattern changes during each epoch of training. This helps the model to learn better representations.\n","\n","No Next Sentence Prediction: RoBERTa removes the Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) objective used in BERT. Research indicated that NSP might not be necessary and could even be detrimental. Instead, RoBERTa focuses solely on the masked language modeling task.\n","\n","Larger Batch Sizes and Learning Rates: RoBERTa uses larger batch sizes and learning rates during training, which contributes to more robust and effective learning.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cBPBPeuDXOWW"},"source":["* Prepare the DataFrame: This involves structuring the data for
